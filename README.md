In this Project Based On SQL, I have used POSTGRESQL.

This Project is done on a dataset of a Music store

I was initially provided with 11 tables worth of data
The Tables contained information from the customer to emply to artists
Queries were run and data was extracted from a single table and even joining 6-7 tables to collect insights

In Queries the "SELECT" and "FROM" were used to pick specific columns of data

The "JOIN" and "SELF JOIN" methods were used to JOIN multiple tables 

The "GROUP BY" methods were used to Group data into segments so it becomes easy for Analysis

The "ORDER BY" and "DESC" were used to sort the Data In descending manner as per to understand the biggest/smallest data in that particular column. 
"ORDER BY" can also be used to arrange specific columns in Alphabetical manner

For the advanced Questions Windows Funtion such as "ROW_NUMBER()" are used alond with Common Table Expression(CTE), for creating a temporary table.
The Data in ths temporary table is used along with "WHERE" to apply a specific condition onto a column to extract data.

ALL of the data extracted through the above method was used to derive meaningful insights, and these meaningful insights shall help in Enhancing the Sales of the Music Store
